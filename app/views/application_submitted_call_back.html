            Your details have been submitted and an operator will call the person you nominated at least once during your chosen time, or as close to the time as possible. <strong>(Wednesday, 15 January 2020 at 15:00)</strong>. When a CLA operator calls, the call will come from an anonymous number.

            <li>The first person you speak to will be an operator who will ask about your problem and your financial circumstances.</li>
            <li> If it looks like you might qualify for legal aid you'll be put through to a specialist adviser, who will make the final decision on your case.</li>
            <li>You will need to provide evidence of your financial circumstances and maybe your problem. Your specialist adviser will explain what is needed.</li>
            <li>If your specialist adviser thinks you need to speak to someone in person or have someone represent you in court, they will organise this.</li>

            If we can do anything to make it easier for you to communicate with us, please tell the operator.
